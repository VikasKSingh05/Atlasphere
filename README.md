### üí° Core Functionalities (Map Interaction & Display)

* **Dynamic Map Loading**: The map initialises with a default view of New York City and loads seamlessly upon application start.
* **Custom Map Styling**: The map uses a custom dark theme, providing a visually distinct and appealing aesthetic.
* **Zoom Controls**: Users can easily zoom in and out of the map using dedicated controls, allowing for detailed or broad views.
* **Reset View**: A "Reset View" button allows users to quickly return to the initial default map view (New York City) and zoom level.
* **User Location**: The "Find Me" feature leverages geolocation to pinpoint and display the user's current location on the map.
* **Custom Markers**: Locations are represented by custom markers on the map, with icons and colors that vary based on their category (e.g., restaurants, parks, museums).
* **Interactive Info Windows**: Clicking on a marker opens an informative pop-up displaying the location's name, category, description, rating, and relevant actions like "Directions" and "Share".

### üåê Location Discovery & Management

* **Preloaded Locations**: The application comes with a predefined set of New York City locations, categorized for easy Browse.
* **Categorised Filtering**: Users can filter locations by predefined categories such as "Dining," "Parks," "Museums," "Landmarks," and "Shopping," to narrow down their search.
* **Search Functionality**: A search bar allows users to search for specific places, utilizing Google Places Autocomplete for suggestions and accurate location finding.
* **Nearby Places Search**: After a search or filter, the map dynamically fetches and displays nearby places based on the current map center and active category, enhancing discovery.
* **Location Cards**: Filtered and loaded locations are displayed in a scrollable sidebar as interactive cards, providing a quick overview of each place.
* **Focus on Location**: Clicking a location card in the sidebar will pan the map to that location and open its corresponding info window, providing a seamless user experience.

### üé® User Interface & Experience

Atlasphere provides a visually rich and responsive user interface:

* **Fullscreen Mode**: Users can toggle fullscreen mode for an immersive map viewing experience.
* **Responsive Design**: The application's layout adapts to different screen sizes, with the sidebar collapsing automatically on smaller screens for optimal viewing.
* **Sidebar Toggle**: A dedicated button allows users to manually collapse or expand the sidebar, giving them control over the interface layout.
* **Loading Overlay**: A visually appealing loading overlay with a spinner and message is displayed while the application initializes, improving perceived performance.
* **Toast Notifications**: Non-intrusive toast messages provide real-time feedback to the user for actions like map loading, location found, or errors.
* **Interactive UI Elements**: Buttons and search inputs have clear hover states and focus styles for improved usability.
* **Location Statistics**: A stats panel on the map displays the total number of locations currently shown and the number of active filters, providing useful at-a-glance information.
